    A C++ reimplementation of a drop-merge sort, originally made by Emil Ernerfeldt:
    https://github.com/emilk/drop-merge-sort

    There are two versions of this function.

    The first one is identical to the reference Rust implementation.
    It doesn't support uncopyable types.
    Here, it's used only for trivially copyable types.
    (just like the Rust version, which required the Copy trait).

    The second version is copy-free, so it supports noncopyable types like std::unique_ptr.
    It's also more efficient for types with expensive copying, like std::string.
    However, being copy-free involves some extra bookkeeping, so for trivial types
    it's a bit less efficient than the original function - which is why I use both versions.
